## **About**

Q. **Who are you?**

A. I've spent the last 14+ years at the sharp end of the sports betting world.  Initially spending 9 years in Betfair's market operations team, subsequently I've worked for major gambling syndicates and for myself.  Going further back I have an Economics BSc from UCL.

Q. **Whats this blog all about?**

A. Its not a betting blog, its a data blog.  Most posts will be a small data analysis, usually sports related, but I'll tackle non-sporting subjects too if I find an interesting data source.

Q. **Whats the code for in some of your posts?**

A. I'm teaching myself Python to help with my data analysis.  Posts will include all the Python code used for the analysis, so I have a little online portfolio.  As I progress with Python hopefully the analysis and visualisations in my posts will improve too!  My posts are originally created as a Jupyter Notebook then converted into a Markdown file for publishing on the blog.

Q. **This blog visually looks good, how did you create it?**

A. This is a Jekyll blog using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/ "Minimal Mistakes") theme.
